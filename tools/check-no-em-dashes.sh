# check-no-em-dashes.sh -- refuse non-ASCII dashes anywhere in the tree.
#
# David, 2026-08-18: no em-dashes in this code base, ever. Stated for SurView
# DIC and carried here on 2026-09-02, when PatternFab became a public sister
# tool: one author, one standard, and a rule enforced in one repository and
# merely hoped for in its neighbour is a rule with a hole in it. 31 non-ASCII
# dashes were swept out of this tree in the same change.
#
# This is a check rather than a note because a rule that depends on remembering
# is a rule that lapses, and an em-dash is invisible in review: it looks almost
# exactly like the hyphen it should have been, in a diff, in a terminal, and in
# a code font. The 179 that had to be swept out of this repository all arrived
# one at a time without anybody noticing.
#
# The substitute depends on where it sits:
#   in a C++ comment      --   (matches SurView and the engine fork)
#   in a user-facing string  -   ("--" in text a user reads looks like a typo)
#   in Markdown           -
#
# Usage: tools/check-no-em-dashes.sh [paths...]
#        with no arguments, checks the whole working tree.
#
# Exits 0 if clean, 1 if any are found.
