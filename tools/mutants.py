"""mutants.py -- break the code on purpose and see whether anything notices.

Ported from SurView, which is the sibling tool and where this harness was
written; the operators, the three-way verdict and the reasoning below are its.
What differs here is only what gets built and which tests get run.

Coverage says which lines the suite EXECUTES. That is a much weaker claim than
it looks: a test can run a line, and assert nothing about what it did. This
asks the stronger question -- change the meaning of a line, and does a test go
red? A mutant that survives marks behaviour the suite watches run without
checking. PatternFab had eight passing test executables and no answer to that
question at all.

Three outcomes, kept apart because collapsing them flatters the score:
  KILLED     a test failed. The suite noticed.
  SURVIVED   everything still passed. The suite did not notice. <- the finding
  NOT VIABLE the mutant would not compile. It was never a real change in
             behaviour, so it is excluded from the score rather than counted
             as a kill, which is what claiming it would do.

Usage:
  tools/mutants.py                      # all of core, all operators
  tools/mutants.py --limit 40 --seed 1  # a quick sample
  tools/mutants.py --files core/src/ConstraintEngine.cpp
