#include <QLabel>

// A word-wrapped label that reports the height its text actually needs.
//
// Ported from SurView, which paid for it five times over.
//
// ⚑ THE TRAP THIS EXISTS FOR HAS NOW BITTEN FIVE PANELS. A wrapped QLabel
// reports ONE LINE as its minimum height, in both directions, so any layout
// that can starve it will: the Analysis panel's notes were drawn over, the plot
// panel's explanation was painted under a native GL widget, the field bar grew
// over the specimen it was explaining, the comparison window's captions had to
// be given room by hand, and folding the Analysis panel into sections clipped
// its speckle estimate through the middle. Every one of those was a note on
// screen and unreadable, which is worse than a note that is absent: nothing
// indicates there is anything to read.
//
// The fix is to answer the layout's question honestly. `heightForWidth()` on a
// wrapped QLabel already returns the right answer; what is missing is
// `minimumSizeHint()` USING it, which is what this class does and what a plain
// QLabel does not.
